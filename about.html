        <center> <p>This website is a very simple website...so far. This is my first published website in the class CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. This website is created using HTML, however also on this website you will see buttons at the top of the screen. These buttons will navigate you to a home page, my javascripts page, my apps page, and my about me page. In the Javascripts page, you will be able to see all the projects that I created using javascripts language. In the apps page you will see all the cool and fun apps that I created while coding. Finally on the about me page, you will see some fun facts about me and what I am interested in.</p> </center>

            In this paragraph you will find out a little about me. I am from the state of Connecticut, I have grown up there my entire life. I have been planning on being a computer science major for a while, however am currently just learning coding. I am a big sports guy, playing four different sports in highschool: Football, Basketball, Track, and Lacrosse. Football has been my main sport since middle school, I loved everything about it, the training, practices, games, etc. I also love going to the beach in the summer. A fun fact about me is I have drove through different time zones twice.
