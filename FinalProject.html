            Welcome to my Final Project Page! On this page you will be able to see the final project that I made, along with the code that was used to make the game, and a video from myself explaining this project. For this project I chose to make a game; this is a slider game which means the user will use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the player (also called "sliding"). In this game the user will be on a sidewalk on what seems to be a nice sunny summer day, however what the user does not know is that there are diamonds falling from the sky, and the user must avoid these diamonds. Once a certain score is reached the user will have won, and the game will return to the start screen.
